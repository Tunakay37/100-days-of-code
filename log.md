# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started the #100Daysofcode challenge.
2. Started learning Object Oriented JS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with a few of the challenges on FCC but eventually I figured them out. What I find funny sometimes is how I just type some stuff into the terminal and it works. I'm like, what the hell?! Then I really look at it and it makes sense. So, I proceed.

### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started creating a landing page for a fashion blog

**Thoughts**: I sorta have issues distributing the content to fit the screen and be responsive.


### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Resumed my exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Finally finished Basic Javascript. Looking to start Object Oriented Javascript tomorrow.
2. Provided help to someone who had issues with CSS.
3. Made new friends with other coders.

**Thoughts:** Productive day even though it took some time to understand some of the Javascript challenges I completed. Sometimes, it just works and you don't know why.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
