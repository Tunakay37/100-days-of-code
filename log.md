# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started the #100Daysofcode challenge.
2. Started learning Object Oriented JS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with a few of the challenges on FCC but eventually I figured them out. What I find funny sometimes is how I just type some stuff into the terminal and it works. I'm like, what the hell?! Then I really look at it and it makes sense. So, I proceed.

### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started creating a landing page for a fashion blog

**Thoughts**: I sorta have issues distributing the content to fit the screen and be responsive.


### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Resumed my exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Finally finished Basic Javascript. 
2. Provided help to someone who had issues with CSS.
3. Made new friends with other coders.

**Thoughts:** Productive day even though it took some time to understand some of the Javascript challenges I completed. Sometimes, it just works and you don't know why. 

## RE-COMMITTING

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Resumed my exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Started Object Oriented Javascript.
2. Also did some ES6 challenges on the beta site of FCC.

**Thoughts:** Pretty great day. Took my time to master the constructors. Learned a few syntaxes in Java.

### Day 2: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Read a lot of Javascript material.
2. Did a few Javascript challenges on Codecademy.
3. Also read up on Responsive design. Really struggled with responsive images; my images weren't responsive. 
   Problem to fix another day, too busy with JS.

**Thoughts:** Can't wait to put all of my Javascript knowledge to practice.

### Day 3: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Finally finished Object Oriented JavaScript.
2. Read jsforcats.com. Really great stuff on that page.
3. Started watchandcode.com's Practical Javascript course.
4. Registered for Hack Reactor and I'm currently going through their pre-requisites. Thank God they have those, I could have been really stuck on their challenges.

**Thoughts** I'm so excited with my progress today. Covered so much ground. I decided to start putting my knowledge to practice by creating stuff. No better way to learn than by doing stuff, eh?

### Day 4: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started working on the FCC algorithms. Found the first two easy to solve, the next one. Not so much.

**Thoughts** Didn't do much today.
