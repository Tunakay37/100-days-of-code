# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started the #100Daysofcode challenge.
2. Started learning Object Oriented JS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with a few of the challenges on FCC but eventually I figured them out. What I find funny sometimes is how I just type some stuff into the terminal and it works. I'm like, what the hell?! Then I really look at it and it makes sense. So, I proceed.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
